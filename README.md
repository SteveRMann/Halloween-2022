# MonsterBox
This project is a monster in a box for Halloween.
It describes building the crate from wood salvaged from palletts,
and the code to randomly open the box.

The motors were from power drills.  The main door motor drives an offset disc, like a cam, that 
bumps the door open anot an inch.  By controlling the door, we can open for a peek or bounce the lid to get attention.

An ultrasonic fog transducer from Amazon is also inside the box to add fog effects.

## Fan

## Notes
